Your challenge is to build out this task management app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
Hide/show the board sidebar
Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
Bonus: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
Bonus: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
